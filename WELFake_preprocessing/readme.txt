The person responsible for creating the sub-dataset, Benny Le, took the WELFake dataset he downloaded off Kaggle and used this Jupyter Notebook to clean it and split it into three sub-datasets.
These sub-datasets were too large to be uploaded here, so to replicate these results, use the notebook file and split a fresh copy of the WELFake Dataset off Kaggle.
